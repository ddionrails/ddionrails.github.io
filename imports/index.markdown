Imports and Exports
===================

Formats
-------

* [questions.csv](questions_csv.html)
* [variables.csv](variables_csv.html)

Conventions

* Some fields in the CSV exports are not part of the import.
  Those fields start with `view_`
* Imports for `logical_variables` and `logical_datasets` are renamed to
  `variables` and `datasets`.
