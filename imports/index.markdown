Imports and Exports
===================

CSV Formats
-----------

See list on the right-hand site.

#### Markdown

In most imports, there is a `description` field using Markdown. For more
information about the Markdown markup language, see:
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

#### Conventions

* Some fields in the CSV exports are not part of the import.
  Those fields start with `view_`
* Imports for `logical_variables` and `logical_datasets` are renamed to
  `variables` and `datasets`.
* Language codes, for all translation purposes: [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)

XML Formats
-----------

* **Endnote:** Publications in Endnote's XML export.
* **r2ddi:** DDI-Codebook-based XML, generated by r2ddi.
* **QeDML:** QeDML-XML from QLIB.

Other Formats
-------------

* **EndnoteKeys** are a special import of two columns (accession number and
  keywords) in addition to the normal XML import. Endnote exports everything
  but the keywords to XML what makes this import neccessary.
