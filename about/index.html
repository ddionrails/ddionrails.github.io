<p>
The data portal <b>DDI on Rails</b> accompanies researchers throughout the entire
course of their research projects from conception to publication/citation.
</p>

<p>
The system offers researchers the possibility to explore the data, to
compile personalized datasets, and to publish results on the publication
database.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to similar products, DDI on Rails is study-independent and
open-source, is able to document data with multiple versions/distributions
and the specific characteristics of a longitudinal study, and is easy to use.
