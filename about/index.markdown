About
=====

Vision
------

The data portal DDI on Rails accompanies researchers throughout the entire
course of their research projects from conception to publication/citation.

The system offers researchers the possibility to explore the SOEP data, to
compile personalized datasets, and to publish results on the publication
database.

In contrast to similar products, DDI on Rails is study-independent and
open-source, is able to document data with multiple versions/distributions
and the specific characteristics of a longitudinal study, and is easy to use.

* [r2ddi](https://github.com/mhebing/r2ddi) extracts metadata from Stata
  files, generating DDI-Codebook XML.
* [soepR](https://github.com/mhebing/soepR) uses the API in DDI on Rails to
  fetch metadata directly into R. In particular, it can run generated scripts
  from the basket without any copy and paste.
* [testdata](https://github.com/mhebing/testdata) offers a comprehensive
  testcase for developing software and workflows, considering the special
  needs of a panel study like the SOEP.
