User Guide
==========

This is a guide how to use the data portal DDI on Rails which is an upgrade to the former SOEPinfo. 

DDI on Rails is created in order to assist the user to explore the SOEP data, to compile personalized datasets and to publish the results on the publication database.  Primarily it guides the user throughout the entire process of their research projects using the SOEP data from conception to publication and citation. DDI on Rails is developed for easier handling than the previously established SOEPinfo.

Search Engine
-------------

On the main page a search option can be found. This is a quick way to be navigated directly to the respective results if the user has a variable name, dataset, topic etc. in mind. It also helps for a quick overview if the user’s interest is to find out if there is any data available for his research topic/question.

For instance, if you are looking for which results will be displayed for the keyword "age", you can find a total of 2614 results listed. However, this may be too overwhelming. Thus, it provides you a way to narrow your search output. Possible classes above the total results are "Concepts", "Variables", "Questions" and "Publications" – all marked with its own symbol in front.

Furthermore, the results of the keyword of interest can be sorted via a study listed on the left-handed side of the total results. The descriptions to those studies can be found on the very top of the page under "Studies" after a particular study is selected and will be specified in the next section again. 

The already mentioned classes with its assigned symbols are listed again underneath the "Study" option and below that another sorting option regarding the analysis unit can be selected. 

Studies
-------

DDI on Rails incorporates a few studies "Families in Germany", "SOEP Core study", "Current Population Survey", "Base II", "SOEP Pretest", "SOEP Test Study", "SOEPlong", "Pairfam" and "SOEP Innovation Sample". The particular study can be accessed through as shown in the picture below. After a study of interest is selected, a general overview will be displayed. Moreover, the total number of involved variables and datasets can be viewed.

In the variable browser, there is another search engine adapted to the chosen study. That way you can find your required variables in the particular study. The same holds for the dataset browser. Furthermore, the variables can be selected according to the desired analysis unit or period on the left handed side.

Topics
------

A variety of topics can be selected on the very top of every page next to "Studies". After clicking on a particular topic, several subtopics appear. The user may also use the search engine to look for specific concepts regarding the chosen topic.

Under "publications" you can search for any keyword and you will be directed to a list of papers that involve the searched word(s). Each result provides a link to the publication for direct access.

In order to use the basket for selecting variables and compiling personalized datasets, you need an account and have to sign in.

After having signed in, a new basket-symbol appears on the very top. Now you can create new baskets and fill in the individual information for each basket.

All variables of interest accessed as previously explained can be selected into your basket now by clicking on the green "Add to basket" symbol underneath the variable in the variable browser. The number next to the basket indicates how many variables are already integrated into your basket.
